description: "SAREF4AGRI extends the SAREF ontology for the Agricultural domain. SAREF4AGRI currently focuses on two examples, which are the livestock farming and smart irrigation use cases. Various other examples exist in the Smart Agriculture and Food Chain domains, such as arable farming, horticulture, agricultural equipment, greenhouses and food chain. As all the SAREF ontologies, SAREF4AGRI is a dynamic semantic model that is meant to evolve over time."
