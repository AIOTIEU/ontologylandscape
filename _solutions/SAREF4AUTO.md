description: SAREF4AUTO is an OWL-DL ontology that extends SAREF for the Automotive domain. SAREF4AUTO currently focuses on three examples, which are the "Platooning", "Automated Valet Parking (AVP)" and "Vehicle environment with Vulnerable Road Users (VRU)" use cases. Various other examples exist in the Automotive domain. As all the SAREF ontologies, SAREF4AUTO is a dynamic semantic model that is meant to evolve over time.
