description: SAREF4ENER is an extension of SAREF that describes energy flexibility that customers can offer to the Smart Grid to manage their smart home devices by means of a Customer Energy Manager (CEM), which is a logical function for optimizing energy consumption and/or production that can reside either in the home gateway or in the cloud. Energy flexibility is expressed in SAREF4ENER in terms of power profiles exposed by devices to the CEM.
