description: Brick focuses on modelling the entities, relationships and contexts surrounding data sources in buildings. To this end, Brick defines (a) a comprehensive class organization of building equipment spanning multiple subsystems  including HVAC, lighting and electrical infrastructure, (b) a set of Point definitions defining the semantics  of data sources, (c) a set of object properties (called "relationships" in Brick parlance) that describe  how entities are composed into complex systems. The ultimate goal of the ontology is to enable "portable" analytics  and control software that accesses a Brick model in order to configure its operation to a particular building  environment.
