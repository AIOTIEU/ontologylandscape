description: The DogOnt ontology aims at offering a uniform, extensible model for all devices being part of a "local" Internet of Things inside a smart environment. Its major focus is on device modeling, for all the aspects needed to abstract device "capabilities" from low -level idiosyncrasies and communication issues. This enables both abstract reasoning on devices, e.g., to find similar devices or to identify the most suitable output to which forward urgent notifications, and actual integration of different technologies, and paradigms.
