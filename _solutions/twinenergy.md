details: 'Sustainable futures: encouraging the implementation of Demand Response Solutions that allow consumers to lower or adjust their consumption to foster global energy savings.<br>Place local communities at the center of energy markets: a shift in the market is possible by enabling the energy trading flexibility by energy citizens.<br>Transform roles in the industry: new business models for local energy communities and retailers to overcome major market entry barriers for prosumers.<br>Deliver an open and interoperable energy solution: connecting smart grids, energy management systems and smart home devices to enable more sustainable, effective and efficient energy use.<br>Provide a worldwide alternative for the energy system: the adoption of the TwinERGY solution will be promoted to maximise the project's outcomes.'
partners: <a href="https://www.twinergy.eu/consortium">Consortium of 18 partners</a>
next_steps: 'Action is taking place in four pilot sites: Bristol (United Kingdom), Benetutti (Italy), Steinheim (Germany) and Athens (Greece). Each demonstration stands up for providing emergent technologies such as smart contracts, smart plugs and intelligent and personalised Demand Response programmes which are used by participants and installed in their homes.'

H2020 project whose objective is to test how digital twin technology can help a more active participation of energy consumers and help them become prosumers. To do so, a suite of innovative tools to predict citizensâ€™ consumption patterns and their comfort preferences are developed, analysing the flexibility potential that individuals, buildings and communities can provide to the electrical grid thus maximising their aggregated value.
