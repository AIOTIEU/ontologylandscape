## AIOTI Ontology Landscape

Choosing the right ontologies is an important basis for successfully implementing semantic systems and achieving semantic interoperability between the systems. To make the choice of ontologies easier, the Semantic Interoperability Expert Group of the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI) Working Group on Standardization has created an Ontology Landscape that currently includes 30 ontologies from different application areas of IoT.
